# React Login using an API key
## Overview
This is a sample application in React that shows how you might go about setting up a login page for a user that gets an api token from a third party server.
In this example the token generation is faked and hardcoded but this could be replaced by a call to an external service.

## Development
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then simply run `npm start` to run the app, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Deployment
Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.
